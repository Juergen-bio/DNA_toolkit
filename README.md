# DNAToolkit

This is a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and manipulating DNA sequences. Built entirely in Python, it provides a modular and efficient way to perform common bioinformatics tasks.

### Features

  * **DNA Validation**: Check if a sequence contains only valid DNA nucleotides.
  * **Sequence Analysis**: Count nucleotide composition and calculate GC content.
  * **Transcriptional & Translational Tools**: Transcribe DNA to RNA and translate DNA into its corresponding amino acid sequence using the standard genetic code.
  * **Reverse Complement**: Generate the reverse complement of any given DNA sequence.
  * **Open Reading Frames (ORFs)**: Identify all potential ORFs in all six reading frames of a DNA sequence.

### Installation & Usage

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Juergen-bio/DNA_toolkit.git
    cd DNAToolkit
    ```
2.  Run the main script with your FASTA file:
    ```bash
    python dna/main.py path/to/your/file.fasta
    ```
